Basic types
-----------
Coordinates and Size and Length
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most of the drawing functions use typedefed 'GP_Coord' and 'GP_Size' integer
types for parameters.

The 'GP_Coord' is signed integer which is used for coordinates and the
'GP_Size' is unsigned integer type used for object size, length and so.

Pixel
~~~~~

Pixel value in 'GFXprim' is an integer big enough to hold the actual pixel
values. The default typedef for 'GP_Pixel' is set to 32 bit integer, which may
be changed at compile time to support colors with more than 10 bits per
channel. The 'GP_Pixel' is thus used as opaque value big enough to hold any
supported pixel value.
