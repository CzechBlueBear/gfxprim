Coordinate System
-----------------

Coordinates
~~~~~~~~~~~

GFXprim uses Cartesian coordinate system. The pixel '(0, 0)' lies at the upper
left corner of the bitmap and coordinates grows to the right and to the
bottom. The last valid pixel, that still lies in the bitmap of size 'w' and
'h', occupies coordinate '(w-1,h-1)'. The precise position of the point with
integer coordinates is in the middle of the pixel (and borders between the
pixels lies are integers + 0.5).

Width and Height
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The width and height, when passed as an argument, are interpreted as number of
pixels to draw (rather than lengt from one pixel center to another pixel
center). Which means that for rectangle of size '(w,h)' starting at '(x,y)'
first pixel to draw would be '(x,y)' and last one would be '(x+w-1,y+h-1)'.
Especially when 'w' or 'h' is less than or equal to zero no action is taken.
