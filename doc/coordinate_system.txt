Coordinate System
-----------------

GFXprim uses Cartesian coordinate system. The pixel +(0, 0)+ lies at the upper
left corner of the bitmap and coordinates grows to the right and to the
bottom. The last valid pixel, that still lies in the bitmap of size +w+ and
+h+, occupies coordinates +(w - 1, h - 1)+. The precise position of the point
with integer coordinates is in the middle of the pixel (and borders between
the pixels lies are integers + 0.5).
