Pixmap widget
-------------

Pixmap widget is a widget that can show a picture.

The `struct gp_widget_pixmap` can be accessed as `widget->pixmap`.

.Pixmap widget constructor
[source,c]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
gp_widget *gp_widget_pixmap_new(unsigned int w, unsigned int h,
                                int (*on_event)(gp_widget_event *ev),
                                void *priv);

Pixmap repaint modes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The pixmap widget is allocated as an empty container and there are two
different repaint strategies for pixmap widget.

Buffered mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this mode a pixmap in the size of the widget is allocated, by the
application, before any drawing is done. The content of the pixmap is
preserved i.e. not modified by the library.

The allocation is deffered for when the application has been started and the
pixel format, we are using for drawing, is known. Only then the library will
call the pixmap event handler with a resize event and
link:widgets_render_context.html[render context] pointer, which could be used
to allocate right backing link:pixmap.html[pixmap] and set the pixmap pointer
in the `struct gp_widget_pixmap`.

NOTE: The pixmap has to be resized properly on each resize event as well.

IMPORTANT: The `GP_WIDGET_EVENT_RESIZE` has to be enabled manually in the
           pixmap link:widgets_events.html[event mask] before the application
	   starts.

See link:example_widgets_pixmap.html[example].

Unbuffered mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this mode the application is passed a temporary buffer in the size of the
widget and a link:bbox.html[bouding box] that describes an inner rectangle
that has to be repainted. To pass the pointer the `pixmap` member in `struct
gp_widget_pixmap` is set temporarily, for the duration of the event handler,
and the link:bbox.html[bounding box] is passed down in the `bbox` member of
the link:widgets_events.html[widget event] structure.

The application is free to ignore the bounding box and repaint the whole
pixmap.

NOTE: The content of the pixmap buffer is not preserved between calls in this
      case so this is only useful when pixmap is repainted periodically and
      the data is not worth caching.

IMPORTANT: The `GP_WIDGET_EVENT_REDRAW` has to be enabled manually in the
           pixmap link:widgets_events.html[event mask] before the application
	   starts.

You may as well enable the `GP_WIDGET_EVENT_RESIZE` if you want to be notified
when the pixmap is resized.
