Library Core
------------

Library core contains all basic data structures and functions that forms the
glue which holds the GFXprim libraries together.

The most important data structure is a link:pixmap.html[Pixmap] which
describes in-memory pixmap which is used extensively in all parts of the
library.

Core also contains link:gen.html[generated] code for basic pixel manipulations
such as link:get_put_pixel.html[GetPixel and PutPixel] as well as
link:blits.html[Blits] implementation.

Library Core is a place to implement common functinonality that is used from
the rest of the GFXprim modules, for example the link:debug.html[Debug layer]
or link:progress_callback.html[Progress callback].
