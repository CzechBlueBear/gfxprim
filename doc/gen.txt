Templating Engine
-----------------

The GFXprim uses python templating engine to generate code for different pixel
types. This is documentation to the engine internals.

GFXprim Config
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The configuration which describes pixel layout could be found in root GFXprim
directory under name 'gfxprim_config.py' which is used to create objects
described below.

Main Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pixel Size
^^^^^^^^^^

[source,python]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
class PixelSize(object):
    self.size = size

    self.suffix = suffix

    self.bit_endian = bit_endian    

    def needs_bit_endian(self):
        ...
    
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Pixel Size object represents pixel as a continous block of data.

The 'size' is size in bits and is sometimes called bpp which stands for bits
per pixel. It also contains suffix that is a string used as a suffix for
functions that manipulates with this pixel size.

The 'bit_endian' determines direction of bits in bitmaps and graymaps (i.e.
most significant bit left or right). It can be either 'BE' or 'LE'.

Note that different pixels can share the same pixel size as for certain types
of operations the function doesn't depend on actual arrangements of the color
channels in pixel (i.e. Get/Put Pixel, Rotate buffer 90 degrees, etc...).

TODO: Rename size to bpp?

Pixel Type
^^^^^^^^^^

[source,python]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
class PixelType(object):
    self.name = name
    self.chanslist = chanslist
    self.chans = dict() # { chan_name: (offset, size) }
    self.pixelsize = pixelsize # bits per pixel

    def is_palette(self):
        ...

    def is_unknown(self):
        ...

    def is_rgb(self):
        ...

    def is_gray(self):
        ...

    def is_alpha(self):
        ...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This object represents pixel type which describes the sizes and arrangements of
channels in a pixel. Note that it carries an instance of pixel size described
above.

The chanslist is a list of triplets describing individual channels as
[('chan_name', 'bit_offset', 'bit_size') ] where 'chan_name' is usually one of
R, G, B, V (value, used for grayscale), A (opacity).

Templating language
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GFXprim uses http://jinja.pocoo.org/[Jinja] templating engine with a few
objects added into the environment.

Added are python buildins:

* 'int'
* 'float'
* 'round'
* 'len'

And most importantly objects generated from the configuration files:

* 'pixelsizes' list of all pixel size objects
* 'pixeltypes' list of all pixel type objects
