General information
-------------------
Gfxprim is simple 2D bitmap graphics library with emphasis on speed and
correctness.

Implemented features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* basic graphics primitives (with and without fill)
** line, circle, ellipse, triangle, tetragon
* text drawing
** supports both proportional and non proportional fonts
** basic font is compiled in the library
** font rendering can be altered by style attributes
** font can be loaded from or stored in file
** convertor from bdf is on the way
* various bitmap formats to draw on
* SDL drawing backend
* bitmaps and blitting
** create, destroy bitmap
** bitmap rotation (in order to speed up rotated blits)

Work in progress
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* bitmaps and blitting
** blit bitmaps (should respect rotation and pixel formats)
** loading bitmaps from image files (jpg, png, bmp, pnm ...)

* backends
** finish frame-buffer backend (SDL does not work on most of my frame-buffers)
** other than SDL X backend (SDL does support only one window)
** some overall initialization routines

Advanced (and unimplemented) features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* bitmaps
** alpha channel

* gfx primitives
** drawing with alpha channel
** anti aliasing
