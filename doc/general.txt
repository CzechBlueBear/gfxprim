General information
-------------------
Gfxprim is simple modular 2D bitmap graphics library with emphasis on speed
and correctness.

One of the key points of the library is code generation. Most of the graphics
operations are written using 'jinja' templating engine which is used to
generate specialized C code. So, for an example, once  you add pixel
definition into configuration file, creating specialized filters, loaders and
conversions to other pixel formats is just a matter of typing "make && make
clean".

The library also includes, fairly optimized, fixed-point image filters, namely
various resampling algorithms used to resize images, low pass filters, etc...
