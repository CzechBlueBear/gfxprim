.Simple yet Powerful Image Viewer.

Spiv is a fast, lightweight and minimalistic image viewer build on the top of
the GFXprim library.

Spiv supports wide range of image formats, currently supported are JPEG, PNG,
GIF, BMP, TIFF, PSP, PSD, PNM, PCX, JPEG2000 and CBZ (as well general ZIP
archives with images), and more will come in the near future.

Spiv implements image caches with LRU (last recently used) algorithm which
speeds up subsequent image operations (rotations, going back and forth).

Spiv can also crawl a directory, there is no need to pass thousand of images
file names via command line arguments.

Spiv supports variety of video backends (via GFXprim backends) currently these
are X11, Linux Framebuffer, SDL and AAlib. Spiv also supports wide range of
backend pixel types from 1bit Grayscale to 32bit RGB with optional
Floyd-Steinberg dithering (even, for example, from RGB888 to RGB565).

Spiv implements feh-like image actions, which are short shell scripts with
printf-like modifiers. The modifiers are substituted to current image path,
name, etc. and executed by pressing function keys.

See 'spiv(1)' man page for more information.
