GFXprim
-------

GFXprim is Open-source modular 2D bitmap graphics library with emphasis on
speed and correctness.

The goal of the library is to provide simple but powerful API for applications
that need to work with bitmap graphics. The library itself started as a
simple replacement for 'SDL_gfx' which was unusable at the time and soon it
outgrew the initial purpose and became the main topic of development.

GFXprim is not tied to a specific graphic system (such as X11) but on the
other hand provides means to interact with them.

GFXprim also includes a simple widget library that could be used to create
user interfaces just in a couple lines of C code.

GFXprim can load and save images in variety of formats, operate on the data on
a pixel level, run image filters, render basic shapes or text, open and manage
X11 windows, draw on Linux framebuffer and more.

GFXprim also comes with link:core_python.html[Python bindings].

There are a few example applications included, the most advanced is a
link:spiv.html[spiv] image viewer which is already a full featured
application.

See the link:about.html[about page] for more detailed information.
