What's not implemented (and should be)
--------------------------------------

* Meditate about bit endians and why these aren't separate pixel types
  (which would make our lives a bit easier)

Advanced features
-----------------

* bitmaps
  - alpha channel

* gfx primitives
  - drawing with alpha channel
  - anti aliasing
