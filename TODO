What's not implemented (and should be)
--------------------------------------

* bitmaps and blitting
  - create, destroy bitmap
  - blit bitmaps (should respect rotation and pixel formats)
  - bitmap rotation (in order to speed up rotated blits)
  - loading bitmaps from image files (jpg, png, bmp, pnm ...)

* backends
  - finish framebuffer backend (SDL does not work on most of my framebuffers)
  - other than SDL X backend (SDL does support only one window)
  - some overall initialization routines

Advanced features
-----------------

* bitmaps
  - alpha channel

* gfx primitives
  - drawing with alpha channel
  - anti aliasing
