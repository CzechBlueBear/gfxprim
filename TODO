What's not implemented (and should be)
--------------------------------------

* bitmaps and blitting
  - blit bitmaps (should respect rotation and pixel formats)
        * IN PROGRESS
  - loading bitmaps from image files (jpg, png, bmp, pnm ...)
  	* IN NEARLY FINISHED

* backends
  - finish framebuffer backend (SDL does not work on most of my framebuffers)
  - other than SDL X backend (SDL does support only one window)
  - some overall initialization routines
  - backed event handling

* Meditate about bit endians and why these aren't separate pixel types
  (which would make our lives a bit easier)


Advanced features
-----------------

* bitmaps
  - alpha channel

* gfx primitives
  - drawing with alpha channel
  - anti aliasing

* freetype support
